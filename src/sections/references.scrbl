The following are academic papers or sources cited throughout this document. All cited papers have passed the peer review process and all cited sources come from prestigious medical or scientific journals.

Please note that many other sources are cited in this document, including Wikipedia, The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Southern China Morning Post, the U.S. Center for Disease Control, the World Health Organization, and others. These sources are used when the claim being proven is trivial (i.e. defining GCJ-02 through Wikipedia) or when other sources could not be found (i.e. State Department Cables). Whenever possible, we prefer an academic or prestigious source over a news report.
